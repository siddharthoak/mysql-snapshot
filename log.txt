Individual stocks and EV ETFs each present different risk-return profiles. Individual stocks offer potential for higher returns but come with significantly more risk. EV ETFs provide diversification but may include companies with limited actual EV exposure. This decision depends on personal factors including risk tolerance and investment expertise.\\r\\nIs it too late to invest in EVs? Not at all. Electric cars accounted for 18% of all cars sold in 2023, up from 14% in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.
